# vrindavan-naad-panchang
Panchang data generator for Vrindavan Naad (New Delhi, Lahiri, Purnimanta)

**Verification:** Phase 1 output was checked against the Rashtriya Panchang
2026–27 (IMD) — all values within 1 minute. Details and open items:
[VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md).

## Running the generator

Setup once (see [Setup](#setup)), then from this folder:

```
.venv\Scripts\python generate.py          # Windows
.venv/bin/python generate.py              # Linux / macOS
```

This writes the files below and runs a self-test (about 10 seconds). It exits
with code 1 if any self-test fails.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data/panchang-2026.json` | 1 Nov – 31 Dec 2026, pretty-printed |
| `data/panchang-2026.min.json` | same, no spaces (for the website) |
| `data/panchang-2027.json` / `.min.json` | all of 2027 |
| `data/monthly/YYYY-MM.min.json` | with `--monthly` only: one minified file per month (2026-11 … 2027-12), same entries and fields as the yearly files |
| `data/festivals-draft-2026.json`, `-2027.json` | festival draft for manual verification — **never shown on the site** |

Not written by `generate.py` (maintained by hand):

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data/festivals-2026.json` | verified festival list for the website, Nov–Dec 2026 — see [Festival dates: always verify](#festival-dates-always-verify) |
| `data/festivals-2027.json` | same, Jan–Mar 2027 (Apr–Dec to follow from the 2027-28 book) |

The date ranges are set in `RANGES` at the top of `generate.py`.

### Monthly files

```
.venv\Scripts\python generate.py --monthly
```

Does everything above (yearly files and their self-test, unchanged) and also
writes one minified file per month to `data/monthly/YYYY-MM.min.json`, each a
JSON array of that month's day entries in exactly the yearly format (about
43–48 KB each, so a page can load just the month it shows). Each file's size
is printed. An extra self-test checks that the monthly files together contain
exactly the same entries as the yearly files, with no missing or duplicate
dates, and that each file holds only its own month. If `RANGES` changes, delete
stale files in `data/monthly/` — the self-test fails on any file outside the
ranges.

### Check mode

```
.venv\Scripts\python generate.py --check 2026-11-01 2026-11-05
```

Prints those days as a readable table (no files written): sunrise, sunset,
Rahu Kaal, every tithi / nakshatra / yoga / karana with its end time, and
Bhadra. Times look like `2:52 PM`, with the date added when it falls on
another day, e.g. `1:11 PM (2 Nov)`.

### Self-test (runs after every generation)

- one entry per date, in order; sunrise before sunset, both on that date
- tithis / nakshatras / yogas / karanas cover the whole day (00:00–24:00 IST)
  with no gaps or overlaps, continuous from the previous day, and tithi
  numbers in sequence
- Rahu Kaal equals the 8-part rule (asserted for every day while generating)
  and lies within daytime
- Vikram Samvat cross-checked against drik-panchanga's own formula
- only digits 0–9 in every file; `.min.json` equals `.json`; every festival
  entry `"verified": false`
- with `--monthly`: monthly files together equal the yearly files — no
  missing or duplicate dates, each file only its own month
- file sizes are printed

### Panchang format

A JSON array, one object per Gregorian date (IST). Times are ISO 8601 strings
in IST rounded to the minute, e.g. `"2026-11-01T14:52:00+05:30"`.

```json
{
  "date": "2026-11-01",
  "weekday": {"en": "Sunday", "short": "Sun"},
  "vikram_samvat": 2083,
  "masa": {"dev": "कार्तिक", "en": "Kartik", "system": "purnimanta"},
  "paksha": {"dev": "कृष्ण पक्ष", "en": "Krishna Paksha"},
  "sunrise": "2026-11-01T06:33:00+05:30",
  "sunset": "2026-11-01T17:36:00+05:30",
  "tithis": [
    {"num": 22, "dev": "कृष्ण सप्तमी", "en": "Krishna Saptami",
     "start": "2026-10-31T16:58:00+05:30", "end": "2026-11-01T14:52:00+05:30"},
    {"num": 23, "dev": "कृष्ण अष्टमी", "en": "Krishna Ashtami",
     "start": "2026-11-01T14:52:00+05:30", "end": "2026-11-02T13:11:00+05:30"}
  ],
  "nakshatras": [{"dev": "पुनर्वसु", "en": "Punarvasu", "start": "…", "end": "…"}, …],
  "yogas": [{"dev": "साध्य", "en": "Sadhya", "start": "…", "end": "…"}, …],

  "rahu_kaal": {"start": "2026-11-01T16:13:00+05:30", "end": "2026-11-01T17:36:00+05:30"},
  "bhadra": [{"start": "2026-10-31T16:58:00+05:30", "end": "2026-11-01T03:52:00+05:30"}]
}
```

- **tithis / nakshatras / yogas / karanas**: every one in force at any moment
  of the date (00:00–24:00 IST), in order, with true start and end (start may
  be on the previous day, end on the next).
- **tithi `num`**: 1–15 = Shukla Pratipada … Purnima; 16–30 = Krishna
  Pratipada … Amavasya.
- **masa, paksha**: as at sunrise. An adhika month is prefixed
  `"अधिक "` / `"Adhik "`.
- **vikram_samvat**: changes at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada (7 April 2027 → 2084).
- **rahu_kaal**: daytime (sunrise → sunset) in 8 equal parts; Mon 2, Sat 3,
  Fri 4, Wed 5, Thu 6, Tue 7, Sun 8.
- **bhadra**: every Vishti karana overlapping the date — listed on both days if
  it crosses midnight; `[]` = none.

### Festival draft format

A JSON array sorted by date:
`{"date", "dev", "en", "type": "festival" | "vrat", "verified": false}`.
Ekadashi entries also have `"smarta_date"` and `"vaishnava_date"` (always
both; `"date"` = Smarta date).

- Festivals come from drik-panchanga's rule catalogue, fed with our sunrise.
  The catalogue leans South Indian (Ugadi, Onam, Upakarma) and mostly uses
  the **tithi-at-sunrise** rule, so festivals that follow another time of
  day need manual checking — e.g. **Deepavali 2026 comes out as 9 Nov
  (Amavasya at sunrise); North Indian Lakshmi Puja follows pradosh-kaal
  Amavasya (8 Nov)**. Same caution for Naraka Chaturdashi, Holika Dahan,
  Janmashtami (midnight), Maha Shivaratri (nishita), Karwa Chauth (moonrise).
- Ekadashi **Smarta**: the first day Ekadashi prevails at sunrise; if it
  prevails at no sunrise (kshaya), the next day (same as drik-panchanga,
  asserted). **Vaishnava**: Ekadashi must already prevail at arunodaya
  (96 minutes before sunrise) — otherwise it is Dashami-viddha and moves to
  the next day — and if it prevails at two sunrises, the second day.
  Names follow the Purnimanta month (Parama / Padmini in an adhika month).

## Festival dates: always verify

The library's festival dates were **wrong at least 6 times in Nov 2026 – Mar
2027** when checked against the Rashtriya Panchang 2026–27:

| Festival | Draft (library) | Rashtriya Panchang |
|---|---|---|
| Dhanteras | 7 Nov 2026 | 6 Nov 2026 |
| Diwali / Lakshmi Puja | 9 Nov 2026 | 8 Nov 2026 |
| Govardhan Puja | 10 Nov 2026 | 9 Nov 2026 |
| Dev Uthani Ekadashi (Smarta) | 21 Nov 2026 | 20 Nov 2026 |
| Pausha Putrada Ekadashi (Smarta) | 19 Jan 2027 | 18 Jan 2027 |
| Maha Shivaratri | 7 Mar 2027 | 6 Mar 2027 |

Decided:

| Festival | Draft (library) | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Makar Sankranti 2027 | 15 Jan | Both, as the book lists: **Makar Sankranti 14 Jan** and **Makar Sankranti Snan-Daan 15 Jan** |
| Vijaya Ekadashi 2027 | Smarta 3 Mar / Vaishnava 4 Mar | Book date **4 Mar only**, no tradition note |

**Causes:** many festivals are decided by the tithi in the evening, in Pradosh
kaal or at midnight, not by the tithi at sunrise that the library mostly uses;
and Ekadashi can split between Smarta and Vaishnava dates.

**Rule:**
- `data/festivals-draft-*.json` are drafts only. **Never publish draft dates
  directly.**
- Only entries in `data/festivals-YYYY.json` with `"verified": true` may appear
  on the website.

**Advisor rules:**
1. When the book lists **one** Ekadashi date but the calculator finds a
   Smarta/Vaishnava split, show **only the book's date, with no note**.
2. v1 shows **only festivals the book names**. Monthly vrats not in the book
   (Pradosh, Sankashti, etc.) come in a later batch.

**Coverage:** `festivals-2026.json` covers Nov–Dec 2026; `festivals-2027.json`
covers Jan–Mar 2027 (Rashtriya Panchang 2026-27). Apr–Dec 2027 will be added
from the Rashtriya Panchang 2027-28.

### `festivals-YYYY.json` format

A JSON array sorted by date; each entry has exactly these fields:

```json
{"date": "2026-11-05", "dev": "रमा एकादशी", "en": "Rama Ekadashi", "type": "vrat",
 "tradition_note": null, "bhadra_note": null, "verified": true,
 "source": "Rashtriya Panchang 2026-27"}
```

- `type`: `"festival"` or `"vrat"`.
- `tradition_note`: `null`, or a short note such as `"Vaishnava: tomorrow"`
  when Smarta and Vaishnava dates differ.
- `bhadra_note`: `null` for now.
- `verified`: `true` only after checking against the Rashtriya Panchang (or,
  for festivals not in the book, a trusted source); `false` entries are held
  back from the site.
- `source`: where the date came from.

Checks when editing: valid JSON, real dates, digits 0–9 only, no duplicate
(`date`, `en`) pairs.

## Library choice

### Fixed settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Location | New Delhi — latitude 28.6139, longitude 77.2090 |
| Time zone | Asia/Kolkata (IST, UTC+5:30) |
| Ayanamsa | Lahiri (Chitrapaksha) |
| Month system | Purnimanta (North Indian month names) |
| Sunrise / sunset | Rashtriya Panchang convention (below) |
| Cost | ₹0 — free, open-source libraries only, no paid APIs |

### Sunrise / sunset convention

Sunrise and sunset follow the **Rashtriya Panchang** (Indian national
calendar): the appearance / disappearance of the Sun's **upper limb** on the
horizon, with standard atmospheric refraction — refraction 31' + semi-diameter
16' = the Sun's **centre 47' below the true horizon**.

This replaces drik-panchanga's default (classical Hindu rising: disc centre on
the horizon, no refraction, about 4 minutes later at sunrise and earlier at
sunset in Delhi). `sun_convention.py` installs it with `sun_convention.apply()`,
so it is used everywhere sunrise or sunset matters: day boundaries
(sunrise to next sunrise), tithi / nakshatra / yoga / karana at sunrise, masa,
Rahu Kaal and the other kalams, and festival rules. Moonrise/moonset are not
affected. Tithi / nakshatra / yoga / karana end times do not depend on it.

Reference check, New Delhi, against the Rashtriya Panchang 2026-27:

| Date | Rashtriya Panchang sunrise / sunset | This generator |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Nov 2026 | 6:33 AM / 5:36 PM | 6:33 AM / 5:36 PM |
| 5 Nov 2026 | 6:36 AM / 5:33 PM | 6:36 AM / 5:33 PM |

Rahu Kaal is rechecked against the 8-part rule with these times in
`scratch_check.py` (1 Nov, Sunday, part 8: 4:13 PM → 5:36 PM; 5 Nov, Thursday,
part 6: 1:27 PM → 2:49 PM).

| Vikram Samvat | ✅ from Kali-day count | ⚠️ fixed year offset | ✅ |
| Festival rules | ✅ most complete: Ekadashi upavasa + parana (kshaya/vriddhi), many festivals (South-Indian leaning); no explicit Smarta/Vaishnava switch | ❌ none | ⚠️ rule table, Ekadashi on one arunodaya rule; no Smarta/Vaishnava switch |
| Lahiri + custom location/time zone | ✅ (default is True Chitra — must set `lahiri`) | ✅ (Lahiri fixed) | ✅ |
| Ease of use | ⚠️ function-level API, installs generic top-level modules (`panchanga`, `config`, `data`) | ✅ one `Panchanga(...).compute()` call | ✅ one `daily_panchang()` call |

Cross-check: for 1 and 5 November 2026 the two Swiss Ephemeris libraries agree
to within 1 minute on every tithi, nakshatra and yoga end time; Kalagana's
independent maths agrees to within about 2 minutes where it finds a transition.

### Choice: drik-panchanga (with pysweph)

- **Licence fits exactly**: AGPL-3.0, same as this repository and Swiss Ephemeris.
- **Actively maintained**, source and issue tracker public.
- **Most complete** for what the website needs next: Purnimanta months, Vikram
  Samvat, Rahu Kaal and the richest festival / Ekadashi rules.
- **Accurate**: Swiss Ephemeris, confirmed against kaalavidya.
- Gaps we cover with our own small code: listing every tithi / nakshatra /
  yoga / karana in a day with start and end (see `scratch_check.py`), and
  Smarta/Vaishnava Ekadashi selection (to be added in the generator).
- Swiss Ephemeris comes from **pysweph**, the maintained fork of pyswisseph
  (same `import swisseph`), because pyswisseph has no wheels for Python 3.12+.

Swiss Ephemeris is AGPL-licensed; this generator is public to comply. Not legal advice.
